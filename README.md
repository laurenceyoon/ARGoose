'ARGoose' is a mobile interactive synthesizer application based on augmented reality. It supports real-time audio effect control through a user interface mediated by a 3D goose graphic object. Dragging the vertical slider up or down changes the height of the virtual goose as well as the pitch level of the goose’s voice in real-time. Similarly, dragging the horizontal slider left or right changes the fat state of the virtual goose and the timbre of the goose’s voice in real-time. Also, the sound volume can be attenuated and panned in proportion to the distance between the user and each 3D Goose object.

### Supported versions & device
